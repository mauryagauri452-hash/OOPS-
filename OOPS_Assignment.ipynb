        "\n",
        "1. What is Object - Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into classes and objects, focusing on reusability, modularity, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template that defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior) for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class that contains its own data and can perform class-defined operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features, while encapsulation restricts access to internal data using methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, and __len__ are special methods that customize class behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance allows one class to derive from another, reusing and extending its attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism means the same function or method name can behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is achieved by making attributes private using _ or __ and providing getters/setters for controlled access.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is the __init__ method that initializes an object when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- @classmethod takes cls and works on the class itself, while @staticmethod doesn’t take self or cls and behaves like a normal function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Python doesn’t support true method overloading; instead, default arguments and *args can be used to mimic it.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that already exists in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- @property allows methods to be accessed like attributes, often used for getters.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- It improves flexibility, reusability, and makes code more general and scalable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class (from abc module) contains abstract methods and cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- OOP provides modularity, reusability, maintainability, and scalability for complex applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variables are shared across all objects, while instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- A class can inherit from more than one parent class, combining their functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the  Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in python?\n",
        "- __str__ gives a user-friendly string representation, while __repr__ gives an official/debug representation.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- super() is used to call methods or constructors of the parent class in a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- It is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod has no access to class or instance, while @classmethod works with class-level data using cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Child classes override parent methods, and the same method call behaves differently depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is calling multiple methods in a single line by returning self from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- It allows an object to be called like a function, enabling custom callable objects"
